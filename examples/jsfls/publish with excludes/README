There are two FLA's you should open for an example of using the lib/jsfl/publish with excludes command.

-open src/library.fla
-open src/example.fla
-publish library.fla
-switch to the example.fla
-run the "publish with excludes" command.

now look at the size of the swfs in the deploy folder, you'll see that the library is 20k
and the example is 4k. The example excluded the example "library classes". As a comparison,
you could publish both fla's without the exclude command, and see that both fla's would
be 20k.
